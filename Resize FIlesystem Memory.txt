******************************************************************
To extend the filesystem on your EC2 instance after increasing the size of the EBS volume, you'll need to follow these general steps:

    Identify the EBS volume: Verify that the EBS volume's size has been increased to 40GB.

    Connect to your EC2 instance: Use SSH to connect to your EC2 instance.

    Identify the filesystem: Determine the filesystem type of the volume. It's typically ext4 for Ubuntu instances, but you can verify this using the lsblk command to list block devices and their filesystem types:

lsblk -f

Resize the partition: If the filesystem is not using all available space, you'll need to resize the partition. You can use the growpart command (if available) to resize the partition:
******************************************************************


sudo growpart /dev/nvme0n1 1

Replace /dev/nvme0n1 with the appropriate device name for your instance.

Resize the filesystem: After resizing the partition, you need to resize the

Based on the output of lsblk -f, it appears that your root filesystem (/) is mounted on /dev/xvda1, and it is using an ext4 filesystem. Here's how you can extend the filesystem:


2. Resize partition
sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1

    Resize the partition: Since you've already resized the EBS volume, you can now resize the partition to use the additional space. Run the following command to resize the partition:

3. Resize File System
sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1

Resize the filesystem: After resizing the partition, you need to resize the filesystem to make use of the additional space. Use the following command:


4. Verify the updated filesystem
 df -h

    This command will display filesystem usage, showing if the filesystem has been extended.

After following these steps, your root filesystem should have been extended to utilize the additional space provided by the resized EBS volume.
